Green-Miles: Transportation & Sustainability 
Project Overview 

Green-Miles is a simple Python application designed to help users 
understand the environmental impact of their daily travel. By entering 
the distance and mode of transport (Car, Bus, Bike, etc.), the system 
calculates the Carbon Footprint (CO2 emissions) and provides eco-friendly 
feedback. 
Objectives 
 To raise awareness about vehicle pollution. 
 To demonstrate the difference in emissions between private and 
public transport. 
 To use Python File Handling to create a permanent travel log. 
Features 
 Multi-Mode Support: Calculates emissions for Car, Bus, Train, Bike, 
and Walking. 
 Real-Time Feedback: Tells you if your impact is "Eco-Friendly" or 
"High Carbon." 
 Data Persistence: Automatically saves every trip to a file named 
travel_log.txt. 
 Error Handling: Prevents crashing if incorrect text is entered.
