## Problem Statement: Why This Project Exists

### The Challenge
Most people don't know the exact carbon footprint of their daily travel. We use cars, buses, and trains without realizing how much CO2 is being released, which harms the environment.

### Our Goal
We need a simple tool to make this impact **visible**.

### What This Tool Does (The Solution)
The **GREEN-MILES** tracker solves this by:
1.  **Calculating** the CO2 (carbon dioxide) produced by different travel methods (car, train, bike, etc.).
2.  **Showing** you a clear, simple summary of your total environmental impact each day.
3.  **Encouraging** you to choose zero-emission travel (like walking or biking) to become an "Eco-Friendly Hero."
