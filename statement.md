Most individuals are unaware of the specific environmental cost of their daily commute. While they may know that "cars are bad for the environment," they lack a tool to measure exactly how much CO2 a 10km car ride produces compared to a bus ride. Without data, it is difficult to change behaviour. This project aims to solve this by providing immediate, data-driven feedback on travel choices.
Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges of the 21st century, with the transportation sector contributing significantly to global carbon emissions. "Green Miles" is a computational solution designed to quantify this impact at an individual level. This Python-based application calculates the Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions for various modes of travel and maintains a historical log, encouraging users to opt for more sustainable public transport options.
